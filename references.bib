    abstract = {Quantum walks are promising tools based on classical random
                walks, with plenty of applications such as many variants of
                optimization. Here we introduce the semiclassical walks in
                discrete time, which are algorithms that combines classical and
                quantum dynamics. Specifically, a semiclassical walk can be
                understood as a classical walk where the transition matrix
                encodes the quantum evolution. We have applied this algorithm to
                Szegedy's quantum walk, which can be applied to any arbitrary
                weighted graph. We first have solved the problem analytically on
                regular 1D cycles to show the performance of the semiclassical
                walks. Next, we have simulated our algorithm in a general
                inhomogeneous symmetric graph, finding that the inhomogeneity
                drives a symmetry breaking on the graph. Moreover, we show that
                this phenomenon is useful for the problem of ranking nodes in
                symmetric graphs, where the classical PageRank fails. We have
                demonstrated experimentally that the semiclassical walks can be
                applied on real quantum computers using the platform IBM Quantum.
